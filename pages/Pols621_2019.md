### COURSE DESCRIPTION: 

### LEARNING OUTCOMES:
At the end of the semester, after completing this course, students are expected to:

- Understand the concept of causality and experimental designs

### COURSE STRUCTURE & REQUIREMENTS:

The class will meet once a week from 1:40pm to 4:30pm on Mondays. Generally you should classes to be about one hour of lecturing and 90 minutes of discussion. We will cover a variety of sometimes complicated concepts. I expect all of you to have \emph{all} of the \it{required} reading done before each class period. Even when I lecture, I expect you to ask questions and participate actively. In the second part of class we will discuss the readings and applications in more of a group setting. We will also try to work through an example application whenever possible. It is important that you familiarize yourself with R before the class starts. 

###  GRADING & RESPONSIBILITIES:

Your grade will be based on the following: 

1. Two discussion questions for every class session (10%)
2. One in-class presentation (20%)
3. Two paper reviews, simulating a review for the APSR/AJPS/JOP (15%)
4. Motivation of Research Question, i.e., paper Introduction (15%)
5. Final Project Research Design \& NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant proposal (30% + 15%) 

- To facilitate discussion, you will send two discussion questions about the readings/class topic at 9 am on the day of our class meeting. These could be questions about things you do not understand or criticisms/suggestions about the readings. 

- Each of you will prepare one presentation about an applied paper for one class session. Your presentation should be a discussion of the paper, include a replication, and potential improvements. You should be critical but constructive. If possible, we may try to establish a video conference with the authors. 

- Pick two papers from the list provided in the Google Team Drive. I will assign each of you two due dates for reviews based on your ranked preferences. You should write a review of the paper as if you are reviewing for the APSR/AJPS/JOP. Your review should be about at least 1 pages single-spaced. On the Google Drive you can find some example reviews done by A&M faculty in previous years __(do not share these reviews)__. Here are some links that may be helpful:

  - [Humphreys on Discussing and Reviewing](http://www.macartan.nyc/teaching/discuss/)

- Submit 1-2 pages (double spaced) introduction/motivation for your research project. Effectively this should be written like the introduction to an article submission. This should be about the same topic/question as the research design and optimally you will want this to be about (or related to) a possible dissertation topic. This introduction needs to clearly state the question you want to answer, why the reader should care (the puzzle), what and how your work contributes to the literature, and a preview (one paragraph) of the research design. I will provide feedback to you on the introduction during office hours. __This assignment is due on: Date__ Two links that might be helpful when writing the introduction:
  - [Keith Head: The Introduction Formula](http://blogs.ubc.ca/khead/research/research-advice/formula)
  - [Andrew Little: Three Templates for Introductions to Political Science
Articles](http://www.andrewtlittle.com/papers/little_intros.pdf)

- The final project in this class is to submit a research design for the project outlined in the introduction. Your research design should be about 5 pages long. The research design needs to outline the data sources and methods used. Downloading data from an existing source and running a panel regression is most likely not sufficient.
__A first draft of the design is due on XXX. The final draft of the research design is due on XXX.__ In addition to the research design, you also combine the introduction and revised research design into the *project description* for an application to the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grants. We will talk more about the research design requirements in class and you can find information about the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant [here](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15571/nsf15571.htm). The goal is for you to be able to submit an application on __June 15, 2019.__ Make sure to prepare for this deadline and talk to your adviser about possibly submitting an application.

The grading scale (in %) used in this class for all written
assignments, and the overall class grade will be the following:

- A= 89.5
- B= 79.5–<89.5
- C= 69.5–<79.5
- D= 59.5–<69.5
- F=<59.6

### WRITING HELP:
The University Writing Center (UWC), located in 1.214 Sterling C. Evans Library and
205 West Campus Library, offers one-on-one consultations to
writers. To find out more about UWC
services or to schedule an appointment, call 458-1455, visit the web
page at [writingcenter.tamu.edu](writingcenter.tamu.edu), or stop by in person. 

You can find some additional resources for academic writing here: [http://fhollenbach.org/WritingAcademic/](http://fhollenbach.org/WritingAcademic/). Writing is one of the most fundamental skills for academics. All of us struggle and it requires a lot of practice. Do not hesitate to ask for help.

### ACADEMIC HONESTY:
All students should follow the highest standards of academic
integrity. __Cheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated in any way.__ If
you are unsure what entails plagiarism, come talk to me. For more
info, see: [http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode &
http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu](http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode &
http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu). “An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or
tolerate those who do.” Your written assignments are to be submitted via Turnitin, which makes the detection of plagiarism and cheating very easy. __Any cases of cheating or plagiarism will be submitted to the academic honor council, no exceptions.__

### READINGS & SOFTWARE:

We will be reading both articles and book chapters throughout the semester. I expect you to do __all__ the required readings prior to sending your discussion questions on Monday morning. Since we will use them a lot, you are required to have the following books.

__Required Books:__

    - Dunning, Thad. 2012. "__Natural Experiments in Social Sciences.__" Cambridge University Press. (denoted NESS below)
    
    - Seawright, Jason. 2016. "__Multi-Method Social Science.__" Cambridge University Press. (denoted MMSS below)
    
    - Angrist, Joshua and Pischke, Joern-Steffen. 2014. "__Mastering Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect.__" Princeton University Press. (denoted MM below)
    
    - King, Gary and Keohane, Robert O. and Verba, Sidney. 1994.  "__Designing Social Inquiry: Scientific Inference in Qualitative Research}''. Princeton University Press.__" (denoted KKV below)
    

For part of this class we will be working on the computer with
statistical software. We will use the statistical programming language
__R__. R is available for download [here:](https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com). I would recommend you download
R-Studio, which is a software (a set of integrated tools) that makes
the use of R much easier. You can download R-Studio [here:](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/). Both R and
R-Studio are free. I would encourage you to install R-studio and play
around with it for a bit.

### CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR, PARTICIPATION, & ELECTRONIC DEVICES:

We will usually once a week during the semester. You can
expect me to be prepared, give lecture, and answer questions. I expect you to attend class unless circumstances prohibit you from doing so. If you must miss class, please let me know in advance. You are still responsible to do the readings and submit discussion questions and assignments, even if you are missing class. 

I strongly encourage you to not use a laptop in class, unless we are working together in R. Laptops have been shown to be a
distraction not only to the students using them but also fellow
class mates. [A recent study has found that not having laptops in class
can have a similar effect as hiring a SAT tutor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/16/why-smart-kids-shouldnt-use-laptops-in-class/?utm_term=.5dd2e4949441) 

![Laptops as distraction](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9oYA4GUAAI0RKf.jpg:large)

If you think you have good reasons for why you need to use a computer, you may do so.

In addition, please make sure your cell phones are on silent mode and
refrain from using them during class time. 

### ABSENCES & LATE POLICY:
Except in the case of observance of a religious holiday, to be excused, the student must
notify his or her instructor in writing (acknowledged e-mail message
is acceptable) prior to the date of absence. In cases where advance
notification is not feasible (e.g. accident or emergency) the student
must provide notification by the end of the second working day after
the absence. This notification should include an explanation of why
the notice could not be sent prior to the class. Accommodations sought for
absences due to the observance of a religious holiday can be sought
either prior or after the absence, but not later than two working days
after the absence. Legitimate circumstances include religious
holidays, illness (verified by a doctor), serious family emergencies
and participation in group activities sponsored by the University,
etc. See [http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07](http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07) for additional
information. Please note that I do not accept Xeroxed copies of
medical excuses from students.

Unexcused late work will be penalized by a 7.5 percentage point deduction for each 24hrs your work is late. For example, if you hand in the assignment on the same day it is due, but after the stated deadline, your maximum score will be 92.5%. If you hand in your assignment more than 24hrs late, your maximum score will be 85%, after 48hrs it would be 77.5%, and so on. Late work will be excused only in the case of university-excused absences. Only under extreme circumstance will I make exceptions to these rules. 

### RE-GRADING POLICY:
Students that want to appeal a grade received on an exam or assignment must submit a regrading request in written form (e.g., email). This request has to be turned in within five working days after the graded exams or assignments are returned to the class. The written statement must explain exactly why the student believes the current grade is incorrect. I will then regrade the entire assignment extra carefully. NOTE, as a consequence your grade may go up or down.

### COMMUNICATION:
The best place to ask questions is in the classroom. If your question
is not related to class material or relevant to other students, we can
discuss it after class. I encourage you to visit my office hours to
discuss any difficulties with the readings or homeworks. Again,
however, you should at least attempt to solve the problem on your own
first.

You can expect me to reply to emails within 24 hours during the work
week. I will not reply to emails on the weekend, except for urgent
matters. As with all business related correspondence, please include
an appropriate salutation, identify yourself, and write in complete
sentences.

### DISABILITY:
All discussions will remain confidential. University policy is in
accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Policy
Statement. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this
legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed
a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of
their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact Disability Services, currently located
in the Disability Services building at the Student Services at White
Creek complex on west campus or call 979-845-1637. For additional
information, visit [http://disability.tamu.edu](http://disability.tamu.edu).

Reasonable accommodations will be made for all students with
disabilities, but it is the student’s responsibility to inform the
instructor early in the term. Do not wait until just before an exam to
decide you want to inform the instructor of a learning disability; any
accommodations for disabilities must be arranged well in advance.

### DIVERSITY POLICY:
The Department of Political Science supports the Texas A&M University
commitment to diversity, and welcomes individuals from any racial,
ethnic, religious, age, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability,
and nationality. (See [http://diversity.tamu.edu/](http://diversity.tamu.edu/). In the spirit of
this vital commitment, in this course each voice in the classroom has
something of value to contribute to all discussions.

Everyone is expected to respect the different experiences, beliefs and
values expressed by fellow students and the instructor, and will
engage in reasoned discussion that refrains from derogatory comments
about other people, cultures, groups, or viewpoints.
