### COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
The goal of this course is to familiarize PhD students with the various existing approaches to research in comparative politics. We will cover different strategies and methods of how to produce high quality research. The course is designed so that students will encounter a number of different perspectives on research in the field of comparative politics. Topics range from  concept formation, case selection, case studies, to concepts of causal inference with observational data, experiments, and mixed methods. Students will learn how to evaluate other scholars' research but also practice skills to develop their own research designs. While most readings focus on research design and methods, we will pursue a "hands-on" approach and read as well as replicate applied work (where possible). At the end students should understand the most common approaches to studying comparative politics in the discipline today.

### LEARNING OUTCOMES:
At the end of the semester, after completing this course, students are expected to:

- Understand:
  1. problems of case selection, 
  2. the concept of causality
  3. the limits and strengths of observational data 
  4. experimental designs
- Be able to understand and apply methods commonly used for inference in observational settings
- Write critical but constructive reviews of peers' research
- Have developed skills to critically evaluate research & for designing their own research projects


### COURSE STRUCTURE & REQUIREMENTS:

The class will meet once a week from 1:30pm to 4:20pm on Tuesdays. For most weeks, you should expect classes to be about one hour of lecturing and 90 minutes of discussion. We will cover a variety of concepts, sometimes complicated. I expect you to have done __all__ of the *required* reading before sending discussion questions. Even when I lecture, I want you to ask questions and participate actively. In the second part of class we will discuss the readings and applications in more of a group setting. We will also try to work through example applications whenever possible. It is important that you somewhat familiarize yourself with R in the first few weeks of the semester. Here is a short document on how to write good r-code:[https://github.com/fhollenbach/CodingRules/blob/master/Best_practices_R.pdf](https://github.com/fhollenbach/CodingRules/blob/master/Best_practices_R.pdf). The document also includes some links to resources for learning R, e.g.,[https://github.com/Joscelinrocha/Learning-R-resources/wiki](https://github.com/Joscelinrocha/Learning-R-resources/wiki).

###  GRADING & RESPONSIBILITIES:

Your grade will be based on the following: 

1. Participation (5%)
2. Two discussion questions for every class session (10%)
3. One in-class presentation (15%)
4. Two paper reviews, simulating a review for the APSR/AJPS/JOP (20%)
5. Motivation of Research Question, i.e., paper Introduction (15%)
6. Final Project Research Design Presentation (15%)
7. NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant proposal (20%) 

#### Readings

We will be reading both articles and book chapters throughout the semester. Readings under the header Additional Readings are not required, but suggestions for those interested in the particular topic. This is a PhD student level seminar; as such I expect all students to come to class prepared, having read __all required material__ prior to sending discussion questions on Wednesday mornings. I also expect you to complete relevant assignments on time.

Some of the weeks have substantial amounts of readings that may take significant time to get through. Make sure you start early enough. Additionally, some of the methodological work will be difficult. It is okay if you do not fully understand everything before coming to class, that is what our class meetings are for. Nevertheless, read carefully and try to understand each article/chapter. Take notes on your readings, especially on parts you do not understand.

If you have not done so, I would advise you to develop a consistent system of reading and taking notes. We will discuss some approaches to reading early in the semester.

Since we will read large parts of them, you should acquire the following books:

__Required Books:__
  - Seawright, Jason. 2016. "__Multi-Method Social Science.__" Cambridge University Press. (denoted MMSS below)
  - Angrist, Joshua and Pischke, Joern-Steffen. 2014. "__Mastering Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect.__" Princeton University Press. (denoted MM below)
  - King, Gary and Keohane, Robert O. and Verba, Sidney. 1994.  "__Designing Social Inquiry: Scientific Inference in Qualitative Research}''. Princeton University Press.__" (denoted KKV below)
  - We will also reference Scott Cunningham's "__Causal Inference: The Mixtape__" frequently. You can find a free version of the book here: [https://www.scunning.com/causalinference_norap.pdf](https://www.scunning.com/causalinference_norap.pdf). You can also think of this book as an additional resource if you do not understand material presented elsewhere. 

When reading applied papers, you should think about questions such as:
    - Question/Framing: What is the question the authors are trying to answer in this work? Is this work important?
    - Theory: Is there an original contribution in the theoretical part of the work? Is the theoretical argument coherent? Are the mechanisms elaborated sufficiently? Are the assumptions plausible? Do the hypotheses follow logically from the theoretical argument? Are there theoretical implications that the authors missed?
    - __Research Design:__ What is the unit of analysis? What is the research design? Does the research design allow the authors to test the specified hypotheses? Does it allow them to answer the question posed in their work? Are there important issues the authors missed? How could the research design be improved? Does the research design allow for causal identification? If not, why not? Is the description of the research design sufficient?
    - Data: Are variables adequately measured and do they correspond to the concepts of interest? Could we improve the authors’ measures? Are other (better) data available to investigate these questions? Is the description of the data sufficient to replicate the authors’ results?
    - Findings: Are the results correctly interpreted? Are the findings substantively important? How do the results correspond to the theory? Are there other potential explanations that are not ruled out by the research design? Are the authors interpreting the results causally? If so, is that justified?
    - Writing: Which sections of the paper are well/poorly written? Why? Are there parts that are particularly exciting/convincing? If so, for what reason? Does the introduction make you want to continue reading the work? What do you think about the overall structure of the work? Pay particular attention to the abstract and introduction.

#### Discussion Points:
- To facilitate discussion, please send two discussion questions/points about the readings/class topic at noon on Monday (the day before our class meeting). These could be questions about things you do not understand or criticisms/suggestions about the readings. I will post the collection of your discussion points to the Google Team Drive by 5:00 pm on Mondays. Please try review them briefly before class.

#### Presentation
- Each of you will prepare one presentation about an applied paper for one of the class sessions. Your presentation should be a discussion of the paper and discuss potential short comings or improvements. You should be critical but constructive. Focus especially on the research design and analysis. If possible, we may try to establish a video conference with the author(s). 

#### Peer Review
- Pick two papers from the list provided in the Google Team Drive. I will assign each of you two due dates for reviews based on your ranked preferences. You should write a review of these papers as if you are reviewing for the APSR/AJPS/JOP. Your review should be at least 1 page single-spaced. On the Google Drive you can find some example reviews done by A&M faculty in previous years __(do not share these reviews)__. Here are some links that may be helpful before writing your first review:

  - [Humphreys on Discussing and Reviewing](http://www.macartan.nyc/teaching/discuss/)

#### Introduction/Research Motivation
- Submit a 1-2 page (double spaced) introduction/motivation for your research project. Effectively this should be written like the introduction to an article submission. The introduction should be about the same topic/question as your research design and optimally you will want this to be about (or related to) a possible dissertation topic. The introduction needs to clearly state the question you want to answer, why the reader should care (the puzzle), what and how your work contributes to the literature, and a preview (one paragraph) of the research design. I will meet with each of you to provide feedback to you on the introduction during office hours. __This assignment is due on: 03/25/2019__ Two links that might be helpful when writing the introduction:
  - [Keith Head: The Introduction Formula](http://blogs.ubc.ca/khead/research/research-advice/formula)
  - [Andrew Little: Three Templates for Introductions to Political Science
Articles](http://www.andrewtlittle.com/papers/little_intros.pdf)

#### Research Design
- The final project in this class is to submit a __research design__. Your final project will be a research design for a future paper or possible dissertation project. Specifically, you should combine the introduction to your research question with a research design section. After receiving feedback on the introduction, you will give a short presentation of your research design during our last class session on 04/29/2019.


*project description* for an application to the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grants.  __The final version of the *project description* will be due on 05/06/2019.__ We will talk more about the research design requirements in class and you can find information about the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant [here](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15571/nsf15571.htm). The goal is for you to be able to submit an application on __June 15, 2019.__ Make sure to prepare for this deadline and talk to your adviser about submitting an application.

Your written assignments will be graded on both content and quality of writing. You can find helpful links on how to write well here: [http://fhollenbach.org/WritingAcademic/](http://fhollenbach.org/WritingAcademic/). Writing is one of the most fundamental skills for academics. All of us struggle and it requires a lot of practice. Do not hesitate to ask for help. If you are having trouble with it, please come see me or visit the University Writing Center (see below).

The grading scale (in %) used in this class for all written assignments, and the overall class grade will be the following:

- A= 89.5
- B= 79.5–<89.5
- C= 69.5–<79.5
- D= 59.5–<69.5
- F=<59.6

### WRITING HELP:
The University Writing Center (UWC), located in 1.214 Sterling C. Evans Library and
205 West Campus Library, offers one-on-one consultations to
writers. To find out more about UWC
services or to schedule an appointment, call 458-1455, visit the web
page at [writingcenter.tamu.edu](writingcenter.tamu.edu), or stop by in person. 
 
### ACADEMIC HONESTY:
All students should follow the highest standards of academic
integrity. __Cheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated in any way.__ If
you are unsure what entails plagiarism, come talk to me. For more
info, see: [http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode &
http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu](http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode &
http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu). “An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or
tolerate those who do.” __Any cases of cheating or plagiarism will be submitted to the academic honor council, no exceptions.__

### READINGS & SOFTWARE:

We will be reading both articles and book chapters throughout the semester. Readings under the header *Additional Readings* are not required, but suggestions for those interested. I expect you to do __all__ the required readings prior to sending your discussion questions on Monday morning. Some of the weeks have substantial amounts of readings, make sure you start early enough. Additionally, some of the methodological work is hard. It is okay if you do not fully understand everything before coming to class, that is what our class meetings are for. Nevertheless, you should read carefully and at least try to understand each article/chapter. We will talk more about *how to read* in our first meeting. Since we will use them a lot, you acquire the following books.


For part of this class we will be working on the computer with
statistical software. We will use the statistical programming language
__R__. R is available for download [here:](https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com). I would recommend you download
R-Studio, which is a software that makes
the use of R much easier. You can download R-Studio [here:](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/). Both R and
R-Studio are free.

### CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR, PARTICIPATION, & ELECTRONIC DEVICES:

I expect you to attend class unless circumstances prohibit you from doing so. If you must miss class, please let me know in advance. You are still responsible to do the readings and submit discussion questions and assignments, even if you are missing class. If you are sick, however, it is best to stay home. 

I strongly encourage __everybody__ to participate in class discussion. Please be respectful to your fellow class mates, do not interrupt them, and wait until called upon. 

I strongly encourage you to not use a laptop in class, unless we are working together in R. Laptops have been shown to be a distraction not only to the students using them but also fellow class mates. [A recent study has found that not having laptops in class
can have a similar effect as hiring a SAT tutor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/16/why-smart-kids-shouldnt-use-laptops-in-class/?utm_term=.5dd2e4949441). If you think you have good reasons for why you need to use a computer, however, you may do so.

In addition, please make sure your cell phones are on silent mode and refrain from using them during class time. 

### ABSENCES & LATE POLICY:
Except in the case of observance of a religious holiday, to be excused, the student must
notify his or her instructor in writing (acknowledged e-mail message
is acceptable) prior to the date of absence. In cases where advance
notification is not feasible (e.g. accident or emergency) the student
must provide notification by the end of the second working day after
the absence. This notification should include an explanation of why
the notice could not be sent prior to the class. Accommodations sought for
absences due to the observance of a religious holiday can be sought
either prior or after the absence, but not later than two working days
after the absence. Legitimate circumstances include religious
holidays, illness, serious family emergencies
and participation in group activities sponsored by the University,
etc. See [http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07](http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07) for additional
information. 

All assignments are due on their due date at the beginning of class. Unexcused late work will be penalized by a 7.5 percentage point deduction for each 24hrs your work is late. For example, if you hand in the assignment on the same day it is due, but after class, your maximum score will be 92.5%. If you hand in your assignment more than 24hrs late, e.g., 1:45 pm the next day, your maximum score will be 85%, after 48hrs it would be 77.5%, and so on. Late work will be excused only in the case of university-excused absences. Only under extreme circumstance will I make exceptions to these rules. 

### RE-GRADING POLICY:
Students that want to appeal a grade received on an exam or assignment must submit a regrading request in written form (e.g., email). This request has to be turned in within five working days after the graded exams or assignments are returned to the class. The written statement must explain exactly why the student believes the current grade is incorrect. I will then regrade the entire assignment extra carefully. NOTE, as a consequence your grade may go up or down.

### COMMUNICATION:
The best place to ask questions is in the classroom. If your question
is not related to class material or relevant to other students, we can
discuss it after class. I encourage you to visit my office hours to
discuss any difficulties with the readings or class. 

You can generally expect me to reply to emails within 24 hours during the work
week. 

### DISABILITY:
All discussions will remain confidential. University policy is in
accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Policy
Statement. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this
legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed
a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of
their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact Disability Services, currently located
in the Disability Services building at the Student Services at White
Creek complex on west campus or call 979-845-1637. For additional
information, visit [http://disability.tamu.edu](http://disability.tamu.edu).

Reasonable accommodations will be made for all students with
disabilities, but it is the student’s responsibility to inform the
instructor early in the term. Do not wait until just before an exam to
decide you want to inform the instructor of a learning disability; any
accommodations for disabilities must be arranged well in advance.

### DIVERSITY POLICY:
The Department of Political Science supports the Texas A&M University
commitment to diversity, and welcomes individuals from any racial,
ethnic, religious, age, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability,
and nationality. (See [http://diversity.tamu.edu/](http://diversity.tamu.edu/). In the spirit of
this vital commitment, in this course each voice in the classroom has
something of value to contribute to all discussions.

Everyone is expected to respect the different experiences, beliefs and
values expressed by fellow students and the instructor, and will
engage in reasoned discussion that refrains from derogatory comments
about other people, cultures, groups, or viewpoints.
