I am an associate professor at the [Department of International Economics, Government and Business](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business) at the Copenhagen Business School. Prior to joining CBS I was at Texas A&M University. I received my PhD in political science from Duke University in May 2015. During the 2014/2015 academic year, I was a fellow at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University.

My research focuses on the political economy of state capacity, corruption, and state development, specifically the development of fiscal capacity. I am currently working on multiple manuscripts that investigate the origins of fiscal capacity in non-democracies and the consequences of variations in fiscal capacity for democratic politics. Related to my academic focus on corruption and illicit monetary flows, I am on the steering committee of the Anti-Corruption Data Collective, a new initiative bringing together journalists, data analysts, academics and policy advocates to expose corruption in developed countries. More information on the collective can be found  [here](https://www.acdatacollective.org/). 

I am also interested in political methodology, specifically Bayesian and spatial statistics. I have taught undergraduate classes on the political economy of development and introduction to political science research methods. At the graduate level I have taught courses in Applied Bayesian Statistics, Comparative Politics Research Design, and Comparative Political Economy. 

Together with Jan Pierskalla at the Ohio State University, I am organizing the virtual workshop in Historical Political Economy. The workshop is a resource for scholars in political science and economics to receive constructive feedback on work in progress in HPE. More information about the workshop can be found [here](https://historicalpe.org/).
