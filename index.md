I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University. I received my PhD in political science from Duke University in May 2015. During the 2014/2015 academic year, I was a fellow at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University.

My research focuses on the political economy state capacity and state development, specifically the development of fiscal capacity and taxation in authoritarian regimes. I am currently working on multiple manuscripts that investigate the link between inequality and fiscal capacity in autocracies and how low levels of fiscal capacity can impact democratic politics in young regimes. 

I am also interested in the political geography of conflict and political methodology, specifically Bayesian and spatial statistics. Since starting at Texas A&M, I have taught undergraduate classes on the political economy of development and introduction to political science research methods. In spring 2017, I taught Applied Bayesian Statistics for graduate students. This year I am serving as the co-organizer of our workshop in Political Economy and Political Violence at Texas A&M University.
