I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University. I received my PhD in political science from Duke University in May 2015. During the 2014/2015 academic year, I was a fellow at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University.

My research focuses on the political economy of state capacity and state development, specifically the development of fiscal capacity and taxation in authoritarian regimes. I am currently working on multiple manuscripts that investigate the origins of fiscal capacity in non-democracies and the consequences of variations in fiscal capacity for democratic politics. 

I am also interested in the political geography of conflict and political methodology, specifically Bayesian and spatial statistics. Since starting at Texas A&M, I have taught undergraduate classes on the political economy of development and introduction to political science research methods. I have taught several undergraduate & graduate courses at Texas A&M, including Applied Bayesian Statistics, Comparative Politics Research Design, and Comparative Political Economy for graduate students. 

Together with Jan Pierskalla at the Ohio State University, I am organizing the virtual workshop in Historical Political Economy. The workshop is a resource for scholars in political science and economics to receive constructive feedback on work in progress in HPE. More information about the workshop can be found [here](https://historicalpe.org/).

On this website you can find an overview of my [published research](pages/publications/), [current working papers](pages/workingPapers), and [teaching](pages/teaching). Here are links to my [CV](papers/CV_Hollenbach.pdf), [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1B4nx4oAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/fhollenbach). Recently, I have put together some resources on improving students' academic writing, you can find those under: [http://fhollenbach.org/WritingAcademic/](http://fhollenbach.org/WritingAcademic/).
